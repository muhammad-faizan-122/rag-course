# 1- A conversation with Andrew Ng

## key-points
*   **What is RAG?** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that improves a Large Language Model's (LLM) accuracy by giving it access to external, proprietary data it wasn't trained on.
*   **Core Idea:** RAG combines traditional search systems with the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
*   **Why it's important:** It's one of the most common LLM applications, used to answer questions about specific products, internal company policies, or specialized fields like healthcare and education.
*   **Key Skills to Learn:** This course covers preparing data, prompting the model effectively, and evaluating system performance to ensure high-quality responses.
*   **Evolution of RAG:**
    *   Newer LLMs with larger context windows are changing how data is prepared and fed to the model.
    *   Improved models are reducing "hallucinations" and can reason over more complex questions.
    *   RAG is increasingly used as a component within larger, multi-step "agentic" workflows.
*   **Agentic RAG:** This is an advanced form where an AI agent, not a human engineer, autonomously decides what information to retrieve, where to search for it (e.g., web, database), and if multiple retrieval steps are needed.

## summary
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by connecting them to external data, enabling them to answer questions on topics beyond their original training. This widely used technique is crucial for applications in customer support, internal knowledge bases, and more. The field is rapidly evolving towards advanced "Agentic RAG," where AI systems autonomously decide how to gather the best information to answer a query.

# 3- Real-World Applications of RAG

## key-points
*   **Code Generation:** RAG systems use a project's codebase as a knowledge base, enabling LLMs to generate accurate code and answer questions that are specific to that project's functions and style.
*   **Customized Corporate Chatbots:** Companies create customer service or internal chatbots by feeding them a knowledge base of enterprise documents, product info, and internal policies to ensure grounded and accurate responses.
*   **Specialized Domains (Healthcare & Legal):** In fields where precision and privacy are critical, RAG allows LLMs to use specific legal cases or medical journals as a knowledge base, making them accurate enough for professional use.
*   **AI-Assisted Web Search:** Modern search engines use the entire internet as a knowledge base to generate AI-powered summaries of search results, directly answering user queries.
*   **Personalized Assistants:** RAG powers personal assistants by using your emails, contacts, and documents as a small but context-rich knowledge base to help with tasks like scheduling and drafting documents.

## summary
RAG is a versatile model with applications ranging from large-scale systems like AI-assisted web search to highly personalized assistants. It enables LLMs to provide accurate, context-specific responses by connecting them to specialized knowledge bases. This approach is key whenever you need an LLM to reason over private, niche, or project-specific information.

# 4- RAG System Architecture

## key-points
*   **User Experience:** The user interacts with a RAG system just like a standard LLM: they submit a prompt and receive a response.
*   **Internal Workflow:**
    1.  The user's prompt is first sent to a **Retriever**.
    2.  The Retriever searches a **Knowledge Base** (a database of documents) to find relevant information.
    3.  An **Augmented Prompt** is created by combining the original prompt with the retrieved information.
    4.  This new, context-rich prompt is sent to the **LLM**, which then generates the final response.
*   **Key Advantages of RAG:**
    *   **Access to New Information:** Makes private, recent, or specialized information available to the LLM.
    *   **Reduces Hallucinations:** Grounds the LLM's response in facts from the knowledge base, improving accuracy.
    *   **Easy to Update:** Information can be kept current by simply updating the knowledge base, without retraining the entire model.
    *   **Enables Citations:** The system can track and cite the sources of information used in the response.
    *   **Specialization:** Allows each component to focus on its strengthâ€”the retriever finds information, and the LLM generates text.

## summary
A RAG system inserts a retrieval step before the LLM generates a response, creating an identical user experience but with a more complex internal process. The system retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base to augment the user's prompt, which is then sent to the LLM. This architecture results in more accurate, up-to-date, and trustworthy responses by grounding the LLM in specific facts.

# 5- Introduction to LLMs

## key-points
*   **Core Function:** LLMs are essentially sophisticated "fancy autocomplete" systems that generate text by predicting the next most probable word or **token** (a piece of a word) in a sequence.
*   **Generation Process:** For each new token, the LLM processes the existing text, calculates a probability for every possible next token in its vocabulary, and then randomly selects one based on those probabilities.
*   **Autoregressive Nature:** The process is **autoregressive**, meaning each token the LLM generates influences the selection of the next one. This creates coherent text but also means different responses can be generated from the same prompt.
*   **Training and Knowledge:** An LLM's "knowledge" comes from being trained on vast datasets (trillions of tokens from the internet), where it learns linguistic patterns and factual information by adjusting billions of internal parameters.
*   **Hallucinations:** LLMs can "hallucinate" (generate plausible but false information) because they are designed to create **probable** text, not necessarily **truthful** text, especially for topics outside their training data.
*   **The Role of RAG:** RAG is effective because LLMs are excellent at incorporating information provided in the prompt (the "context") to ground their responses in facts, even if that information is new to them.
*   **Context Window:** A key limitation is the **context window**, which is the maximum number of tokens an LLM can process at once. This makes it crucial for the RAG system's retriever to select the most relevant and concise information.

## summary
Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by predicting the next most probable token in a sequence, a process that is both random and self-influencing. Their knowledge is limited to their training data, which can lead to "hallucinations." RAG systems overcome this by inserting relevant, factual information directly into the prompt, leveraging the LLM's strength at using context to generate a grounded response.

# 6- Introduction to Information retrieval

## key-points
*   **Purpose:** The retriever's job is to find and provide the LLM with useful, relevant information from a knowledge base that the model wasn't trained on.
*   **Library Analogy:** The retriever acts like a librarian; it understands your "question" (the prompt) and searches its "library" (the knowledge base) for the most relevant "books" (documents).
*   **Indexing:** To make searching efficient, the retriever first organizes and creates an **index** of all the documents in the knowledge base.
*   **Search Mechanism:** It finds relevant documents by calculating a **similarity score** between the user's prompt and each document, then returns the top-ranked ones.
*   **The Core Challenge:** The retriever must balance finding all relevant documents while excluding irrelevant ones to avoid overwhelming the LLM's context window. Deciding *how many* documents to return is a key tuning parameter.
*   **Common Technology:** While other databases can be used, most production-level RAG systems use a **vector database**, which is specially designed for fast and efficient similarity searches.

## summary
The retriever acts as the search component of a RAG system, finding the most relevant documents from a knowledge base to give context to the LLM. It works by understanding the user's prompt and ranking documents based on a similarity score. For production systems, this process is typically powered by a specialized vector database for efficient searching.

# 7- Conclusion

## key-points
*   **Goal of RAG:** To make LLMs more useful and accurate by giving them access to information they weren't trained on (e.g., private, recent, or specific data).
*   **Core Components:** The system pairs a Large Language Model (LLM) with a **Knowledge Base** (a collection of data).
*   **Process Flow:**
    1.  A user submits a prompt.
    2.  The prompt is first sent to a **Retriever**.
    3.  The Retriever searches the Knowledge Base for relevant documents.
    4.  Text from these documents is added to the original prompt.
    5.  The LLM receives this augmented prompt and generates a response.
*   **Outcome:** The retrieved information **grounds** the LLM's final response, making it more accurate and relevant.
*   **Next Steps:** The rest of the course will deep-dive into each component, covering how they work and how to optimize their performance.

## summary
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLM accuracy by connecting them to an external knowledge base of specific information. A retriever finds relevant data and adds it to the user's prompt, creating a context-rich query for the LLM. This process grounds the model's output, resulting in more accurate and reliable responses.
